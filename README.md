## Hi there 👋

I build tools and systems that make development simpler, more portable, and more resilient.

In recent years my focus has shifted toward creating **practical developer tooling** and **architecture patterns** that solve real problems I encounter in day-to-day engineering work. I value solutions that remain flexible over time and avoid vendor lock-in.

### 🛠 What I’m building

* 🧰 **Developer tools & CLI utilities** designed to streamline workflows and remove friction
* 🔧 Tools that solve my own engineering challenges — then evolve into reusable assets
* 🌍 **Portable, vendor-neutral solutions** that work across environments and ecosystems

### 🌐 Architectural & engineering interests

* distributed and serverless (peer-to-peer) free software
* building systems that function without centralized dependencies
* enabling resilience and autonomy through decentralization
* practical approaches to modular and evolutionary design

### ⚙️ Practices & approach

* functional and reactive design principles
* scalable, composable systems
* clarity through immutability and predictable flow
* tooling that reinforces good engineering habits

### ⚙️ Tech & focus

`.NET` • `Typescript` • Developer Tooling • Modular Systems • Functional & Reactive Practices • Distributed Systems • Portable Software

> I enjoy building tools that I want to use — portable, resilient, and free from unnecessary constraints.
